# Data Structures in Assembly Language

This repository contains the implementation of common data structures, written in Assembly Language, as part of a personal challenge. The goal is to understand the inner workings and design of fundamental data structures at a low level.

### Using with C
All functions in this repository follow the `cdecl` calling convention, enabling easy integration with C code. Should you find a use for this code, feel free to incorporate it into your projects. A header file is provided in the `src` directory to enable statically linking against the provided implementations.

To utilize the code in this repository in your C projects:
1. Include the header file located in the `src` directory in your project.
2. Link your project against the provided Assembly implementations.

## üêõ Contributing
While I appreciate the interest, I am currently only accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. This is primarily a learning project, and I would like to implement the data structures myself to gain a deeper understanding of their workings. However, if you find any issues or discrepancies, please feel free to open an issue.

### Opening an Issue
1. **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check the existing open issues to avoid duplicates.
2. **Provide Detailed Information:** When opening a new issue, provide as much detail as possible about the bug, including steps to reproduce it and any potential fixes you might suggest.
